Excellent 🎯 — you’ve got a *perfect educational demo* here!
Your GUI Dice Roller not only makes the lesson fun, but it also visually demonstrates **user-defined functions** and **built-in functions** (`random.randint()`, `random.seed()`).

Below is a **complete presentation scenario + explanation script** that walks your viewers through what’s happening — ideal for your group’s video narration.

---

## 🎬 Scenario Title

**“Predicting the Future with `random.seed()` – The Dice Game Demo”**

---

## 🧩 Scene Overview

* **Goal:** Show how `seed()` controls randomness, and how a custom function (`roll_dice`) uses built-in functions to perform tasks.
* **Main Focus:** Function concept, randomness, reproducibility.
* **Tools Used:** Python `tkinter` (for GUI), `random` module, Unicode dice faces.

## 🗺️ Flow of Demonstration (approx. 5–7 minutes)

| Stage | Purpose                                       | What to Say / Show                                                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣   | Introduction                                  | Introduce the idea of rolling dice and randomness.                                           |
| 2️⃣   | Explain `random.randint()`                    | Show that each dice face is randomly generated.                                              |
| 3️⃣   | Explain `roll_dice()` (user-defined function) | Show how this function uses `randint()` multiple times.                                      |
| 4️⃣   | Explain `random.seed()`                       | Show that when we set the same seed, the random results repeat — like “predicting” the dice. |
| 5️⃣   | Run & observe                                 | Click the button multiple times and explain the output.                                      |

## 🎙️ Suggested Narration Script (for your video)

---

### 🧠 **Part 1 – Introduction (Speaker 1)**

> “Now that we understand what a Python function is, let’s look at a fun example — a *Dice Roller* game made with Python’s `tkinter` GUI.”
>
> “In this game, we’ll roll three dice, add them up, and decide whether the result is *Tài* (big) or *Xỉu* (small).
> If the total is greater than 10, it’s *Tài* — otherwise, it’s *Xỉu*.”

---

### 🎲 **Part 2 – Demonstrating `roll_dice()` (Speaker 2)**

> “Here’s our user-defined function called `roll_dice()`.
> Each time the button is clicked, this function is executed.”

Show on screen:

```python
def roll_dice():
    first_die = random.randint(1,6)
    second_die = random.randint(1,6)
    third_die = random.randint(1,6)
    ...
```

> “Inside this function, we use another function — `random.randint(1,6)` — to simulate rolling a die.
> It’s a *built-in function* from Python’s `random` module that gives a random integer between 1 and 6.”

> “Then we add up the three dice, and based on the sum, display *Tài* or *Xỉu* on the screen.”

---

### 🧮 **Part 3 – Explaining `randint()` (Speaker 3)**

> “The `randint()` function is what gives our dice their randomness.
> Every time we call `randint(1,6)`, it picks a new number between 1 and 6.
> So normally, the result is unpredictable — just like rolling a real die.”

Run the program once *without seed* (comment out `random.seed(8686868)`)

> “Let’s try running it a few times… notice that the dice faces and the result change every time.”

---

### 🔮 **Part 4 – Introducing `random.seed()` (Speaker 4)**

> “But what if we *want* to predict the result?
> Or we want our random numbers to be the same every time we run the program — for testing or demonstration?”

> “That’s where `random.seed()` comes in.
> It sets the starting point for Python’s random number generator.”

Show on screen:

```python
random.seed(8686868)
```

> “If we use the same seed — here it’s 8686868 — Python will produce the *exact same sequence* of random numbers each time.”
> “It’s like we’ve fixed the dice in time — every time we roll, we’ll get the same outcome.”

---

### 🧪 **Part 5 – Demonstration (Speaker 2 or 3)**

Run the program again.

> “Now we’ll click the *Roll Dice* button multiple times.
> Notice how the dice show the same combination every time you restart the program — even though we’re using random numbers!”

Show output on screen:

```
🎲 Ba viên xúc xắc: [4, 2, 6]
👉 Kết quả: Tài!
```

> “That’s because our seed value `8686868` generates this exact random sequence.
> If I change the seed, the results will change — but remain consistent for that new seed.”

---

### ⚙️ **Part 6 – Teaching Moment: Function Interaction**

Show small diagram:

```
random.seed()  → sets the pattern
random.randint()  → uses that pattern to generate numbers
roll_dice()  → calls randint() 3 times and returns the total
```

**Speaker 1:**

> “This example beautifully demonstrates how functions work together:
>
> * A **built-in function** like `randint()` provides base functionality.
> * A **user-defined function** like `roll_dice()` combines logic to create something meaningful.
> * And `seed()` helps us control and test our randomness — turning chaos into predictability.”

---

### 🧠 **Part 7 – Summary (Speaker 4)**

> “So from this one small game, we’ve learned three powerful ideas in Python:
> 1️⃣ How to define and call a function (`roll_dice()`)
> 2️⃣ How built-in functions work (`random.randint()`)
> 3️⃣ How to control randomness with `random.seed()` — letting us ‘predict the future’ when coding.”
