Animated Code Execution, powered by Manim (https://manim.community)

This does not have a guaranteed stable API.

This is not an official Manim project. It worked with Manim Community version 0.17.2, last I checked.

See `sample_code.py` for a small example and ExampleScene.mp4 for the output

See `connect_four.py` for a full example. The [output is on my YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFtJt1_T3k).
Bear in mind that I wrote `connect_four.py` to run *once*,
but spent a bit more time on the code in `manim_ace` to be more reusable across projects.

If you use this code (or a fork) to generate videos, those videos are yours to do what you like with.
